H2Odb
=====

A simple program for loading water analysis records from an Excel spreadsheet into an Access database. Probably useful only to the hydrogeology group at the New Mexico Bureau of Geology, at best.

------------

H20db may be built and installed using [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/ "sbt") (tested with 0.12.x, and 0.13.x up to 0.13.8).
